Salesforce Digital Experience portal for Clients

This is a Salesforce Digital Experince Lightning Web Component used to display Client information from their record in Salesforce. 

The component was designed to display files required for upload, a file upload box, a comment section for client facing updates, and a list of files uploaded. 

This is used both internally (employee facing) and externally (client facing). The client will login to view their list of required documents gnereated from a Salesforce Screen Flow by an employee. 

When the client uploads a document, it will alert the associated contact with an email (done through a Salesforce Flow)
